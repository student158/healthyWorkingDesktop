Healthy working for Desktop
================================

Sitting too much is [bad for your health](https://mayocl.in/3p0takQ) and developers often sit too much. I made this app to remind me when I code or study. When I sit for 25 mins (my preference), the app will notify me to stand up and exercise about 5 mins.

Note: This app uses webcam to detect sitting.
