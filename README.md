Healthy working for Desktop

Sitting too much is [bad for your health](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005#:~:text=Research%20has%20linked%20sitting%20for,that%20make%20up%20metabolic%20syndrome.) and developers often sit too much. I made this app to remind me when I code or study. When I sit for 25 mins (my preference), the app will notify me to stand up and exercise about 5 mins.

Note: This app uses webcam to detect sitting.
